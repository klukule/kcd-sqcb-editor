# SQCB Editor
This tool is still WIP, but in it's current state supports everything required for easier modification of SQCB files

What you can do:
* Create new SQCB files
* Open existing files
* Export all OGG sounds
* Import new OGG sounds
* Remove OGG sounds from the file
* Play the sounds with integrated player

## 3rd party tools used
* [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/) (Used the library + based my player on one of their demos)
* [NAudio.Vorbis](https://github.com/naudio/Vorbis) (OGG reader)
